# odin-recipes
This is the first project assignment as part of the foundations course on 'The Odin Project'. 
We are required to create a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of:
    <p>- An index page with links to 3 recipes</p>
    <p>- Each recipe will have ingredients and instructions required to make the dish</p>
