    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easy to make fried chicken wings, based on Vancouver's own Phnom Penh restaurant in downtown Vancouver City.  This recipe will be using an air fryer to get you that big crunch, while maintaining a juicy tender meat.</p>
        <p>I first ate these wings on a trip with my then girlfriend (now wife) in 2018.  The simplicity of the wings are a nice step away from today's sauce-filled family-sized-buckets of calorie drenched fast food titans.
            For those of us who need to count calories at times, this is the perfect dish that keeps you full without having to switch to your stretchy pants.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Wings (2-3 pounds)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Butter</li>
            <li>4 limes (depends on the size)</li>
            <li>1 Head of Garlic</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>3 stalks cilantro (optional)</li>
            <li>Potato starch or corn starch</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li> 
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Defrost wings to room temperature</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Start with the 1/4 cup fish sauce in a bowl, put the 1/4 cup sugar into the bowl and mix until sugar is dissolved</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Take 1 lime, bring to room temperature and roll the lime on a flat surface, to get more juice.  Juice the lime and add to the fish sauce mixture.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Chop and add 4 cloves of garlic to the sauce</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Marinate chicken wings with the sauce in a big bowl. Mix and then marinate in the fridge for 20-30 minutes.  You do not want to marinate more than 1 hour as the lime juice will breakdown the meat.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Take out the marinated wings, and prepare to coat the wings in the Potato starch.  Use 1/2 cup on a plate to coat the wings, if you need more potato starch, feel free to add.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>When marinating the wings, be sure shake any excess liquid off the wings before coating with the Potato starch.  Lightly coat the wings.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pre-heat the air fryer for 4-5 minutes at 200 degrees celsius</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Line up in the air fryer and fry for 10 minutes</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>After 1 minutes flip the wings and keep cooking for another 10 minutes or until crispy and brown</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>While the wings are frying chop the green onions and cilantro</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>To create the dipping sauce, take another lime and get the juice, put it in a bowl</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt and about 1/2 a teaspoon of black pepper, mix well.  The sauce should look greyish, adjust as needed</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Mince another 4 cloves (or more) of garlic</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In a skillet or small pot, melt the butter, be sure not to burn</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once the butter has melted, turn the heat down to low, and then add the minced garlic and a pinch of salt </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Take the wings out of the air fryer and transfer to a bowl, add in the butter garlic sauce, green onions, and cilantro, mix well.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add in a pinch of sugar for additional taste (optional)</li>
        
        </ol>
