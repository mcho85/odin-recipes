<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If there is one food, that I wouldn't mind eating for the rest of breakfeast days, its the breakfeast burrito.  I think its the most versatile breakfeast food you can get, it can be a simple and quick meal for professionals on the go, or you can turn it into a massive log of deliciousness</p>
<p>Its the staple of many white and blue collar jobs from NYC to LA, but has started sprouting up in major metropolisis as far away as Singapore and Shanghai.  It works with one ingrediant or ten, the only thing holding you back is the size of your tortilla.</p>
<p>This recipe will be a play on the southwest breakfeast burrito, we will be making enough breakfeast burritos to last you a week.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>12 eggs</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 red onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 tomato diced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>1 (3.5 ounce) can diced jalpenos (optional)</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>20 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt in a large bowl. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes. Chop the cooked eggs and place in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and stir in the sausage and garlic. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, then add the onion. Continue cooking and stirring until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Combine the sausage with the eggs, tomato, cilantro, jalapeno, and taco seasoning. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then stir in the Cheddar cheese.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Place a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon some of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of the tortilla. Flatten the filling into rectangle shape with the back of a spoon. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges. Roll the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Tightly wrap individual burritos with plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve. Heat in the microwave until hot, 3 to 4 minutes, before serving.</li>
