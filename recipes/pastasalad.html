<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Craving something healthy and hearty? This is my go-to comfort salad.  More pasta than salad, it has a hearty helping of vegetables and carbs to keep you energized and going through out the day.</p>
<p>The great thing about pasta salad is how versatile it can be with other foods, cold cuts, tuna fish, corn, fruits, there are endless possibilities that can store up to a week, making this a great addition to any meal.  </p>
